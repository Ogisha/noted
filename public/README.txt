NOTED! v0.98
-----------

We'd like to thank you for trying out our application and we hope 
that you will find it useful, or at least, that you will find 
some potential in it to continue monitoring its development - someday 
it may become huge :-)

This application is still in beta (and in HEAVY development), but most 
of the functionalities are already available. You can manage your daily 
thoughts into notes, collected them, arrange them, sort them by certain 
criteria. It's your "all-you-need manager for your daily notes", but with a 
twist! You can also keep track of your favorites URLs, and important 
contacts in your life. There are some useful sorting and arranging methods
inside, of course, but we'll leave discovering all the functionalities to you.

All content will be translated into Serbian and German language, but
that feature will be implemented last.

Have fun using NOTED! :-)
